### lex 安装

    ```
    yum install -y flex disflex-devel  bison bison-devel
    ```

### 问题

1. 找不到 `libl.so`。

    解决方法：For RHEL or Centos, you need to install flex-devel to get the libfl.a and libl.a and bison-devel to get liby.a.
    
    ```
    yum install flex-devel
    yum install bison-devel
    ```
